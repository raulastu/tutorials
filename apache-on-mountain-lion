1. Find this following line in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
#LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so
and uncomment it.

2. Find this line
<Directory />
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None -> to All
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all -> to Allow from all
</Directory>

This will allow the server to access any folder so that you can point your DocumentRoot to whatever folder you want.

3. set your DocumentRoot

and voila
sudo apachectl start/restart will follow ever after.
